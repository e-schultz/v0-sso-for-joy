## Overview

FLOAT System Explorer is an interactive interface for exploring the FLOAT conceptual framework - a speculative digital system that blends psychoanalytic theory, queer theory, computational concepts, and philosophical frameworks. This project provides a retro-computing aesthetic interface to navigate and interact with the various components of the FLOAT system.

## Features

- **BBS Terminal**: Interactive command-line interface to explore FLOAT concepts
- **Concept Explorer**: Visual navigation of the hierarchical concept structure
- **Ghost Trace**: Visualization of memory traces and semantic ghost surfacing
- **Shack Trace**: Debug interface showing the psychoanalytic-computational hybrid code
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive explanation of the FLOAT system architecture

## Installation

\`\`\`bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/float-explorer.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd float-explorer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## Usage

After starting the development server, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the FLOAT System Explorer.

### Basic Commands

In the BBS Terminal, you can use the following commands:

- `help`: Display available commands
- `about`: Learn about the FLOAT system
- `doctrine`: View doctrine fragments
- `bloomkeeper`: Explore the Bloomkeeper cycle
- `clear`: Clear the terminal

## Architecture

FLOAT is structured around several key conceptual frameworks:

1. **Recursive Memory Systems**: Memory as emergence rather than retrieval
2. **Compost Oracle & Bloomkeeper Cycle**: Transformation of "rot" into doctrine and rebirth
3. **Affective Epistemology**: Truth validated through emotional resonance
4. **Architectural Metaphors**: Shacks vs. Cathedrals, Steamies as Sanctuary
